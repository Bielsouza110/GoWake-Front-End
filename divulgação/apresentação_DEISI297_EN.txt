This project aims to architect a more sophisticated and suitable system, an application, designed to assist Wakeboard competitions by differentiating athletes through heats. Its main objective is to provide real-time updates of the respective athletes' scores, with the intention of being used in the future by the International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation (IWWF).

Athletes participating in a competition are distributed across categories (age groups), organized into heats (groups of athletes) and rounds. The highest-scoring athletes from each heat advance to the next round until reaching the final.

This web application manages all Wakeboard competitions and includes the following features:

1. Event creation: Allows the creation of new competition events.

2. Association of athletes and officials (judges) to the event: Enables the association of participating athletes and officials responsible for judging with the specific event.

3. Distribution of athletes by categories: Facilitates organizing athletes into their respective age categories.

4. Creation of rounds and distribution of athletes into heats: Allows the creation of competition rounds and the distribution of athletes into different heats.

5. Association of officials to heats: Enables the assignment of officials responsible for each competition heat.

6. Recording scores assigned by judges to each athlete in each heat: Enables the registration of scores given by judges to each athlete during the competition heats.

7. Management of advancement to the next rounds: Assists in managing the process of classifying athletes for the subsequent rounds based on their scores.

The ultimate goal of this project is to deploy the application and make it available for use by the International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation. Due to the complexity and importance of the work, it has been divided into two main components: backend and frontend. This particular work focuses primarily on the frontend, while the backend has been developed within the scope of the DEISI 314 project.
